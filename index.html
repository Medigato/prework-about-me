      <p>They had told me about them before. The giant cats of Cat-torini. I stood on a roof watching the horizon thru the buildings. When it appeared, unusually silent despite their large size, I was taken aback. The cat walked up then laid on the side of the mountain with grace. The ground didn't even shake.
"The sightings aren't unusual, once you get used to them. Aye, the old cats of legend, they kept living here, unaware of their extinction. I guess they were to busy rampaging thru the buildings and scratching their backs on the skirts of the mountain. The buildings fall, my lord, to be sure, but it is worth. What would life be without them, dull, unnecesarily quiet."</p>
